# DungeonCrawler_CorePhase

This project is a vertical slice of a 2D top-down dungeon crawler built with **Unity 6 URP**. It is part of a structured learning roadmap toward becoming a professional game engineer by 2027.

## 🧩 Features Implemented (WIP)

- 🎮 New Unity Input System (Action Maps, Player controls)
- 🧠 Clean Code Architecture (Single Responsibility, decoupled components)
- ⚙️ ScriptableObjects for data-driven inventory and item setup
- 🔁 Observer Pattern for UI events and gameplay state updates
- 🎥 Cinemachine for smooth 2D camera following
- 🧱 Tilemap-based level with physics-based collision
- 🗝️ Interactive elements (e.g., chests, doors, items)
- 📦 Git-based version control with atomic commits

## 📁 Project Structure

Assets/
├── _Scripts/ # Organized by feature: Core, Player, UI, Interactables
├── Prefabs/ # Player, Items, Environment
├── ScriptableObjects/ # Item definitions and runtime config
├── Scenes/ # MainScene.unity
├── UI/ # Canvas and UI assets


## 🎮 Controls (current setup)

| Action      | Key       |
|-------------|-----------|
| Move        | WASD      |
| Interact    | E         |
| Sprint      | Left Shift (if enabled) |
| Inventory   | I (Planned) |

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Unity 6 (URP 2D Template)
- Unity Input System (Event-driven)
- C# (2025 version)
- GitHub Desktop for commits
- Visual Studio Community

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the folder with Unity Hub (Unity 6.x or newer)
3. Open `MainScene.unity` from `Assets/Scenes`
4. Hit Play to test basic player movement and camera

> ✅ Designed to be WebGL compatible in later stages

## 📚 Learning Goal

This project follows a roadmap designed for the 2026 Indian game job market, focusing on:
- Engine proficiency (Unity 6, URP)
- Clean code practices
- Data-oriented patterns (ScriptableObjects)
- Version control (Git discipline)
- DSA and math integration (in progress)

## 📅 Progress Log

- Week 1: Project setup, Input System, Player movement
- Week 2: Tilemap, collisions, camera, UI
- Week 3+: Interactables, inventory, game logic loop
